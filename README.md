# PCB-Swatch
A PCB Swatch to see all layer config next to the other options 2-layer

This repo is made with the idea to collect different files/projects in one place.
These files/projects are for PCB Swatches that indicate the different effect of layers and the different effect of layers next to each other.

## 2-layer PCB
The kicad files for the 2-layer PCB can be found in the 2layer layer swatch folder.

## 2 Layer full color
This currently contains the easyeda files that have been used to make this project.
The component is in there to be able to do a copper pour on one of the sides, to be able to see the difference.
